# SpotifyInSwift
This is the latest Spotify Demo written in Swift 3. I will try to keep it up to date.

I spent a while looking for this online, and I was only able to come up with bits and pieces with how fast Spotify's SDK is changing, and with Swift changing at a fast pace as well. I hope this helps out anyone else trying to add Spotify to their project, and only ask that you give me credit for my work if you use my code. I have no license attatched to this, so... enjoy!
