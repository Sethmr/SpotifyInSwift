# SpotifyInSwift
This is the latest Spotify Demo written in Swift 3. I will try to keep it up to date.

I spent a while looking for this online, and I was only able to come up with bits and pieces with how fast Spotify's SDK is changing, and with Swift changing at a fast pace as well. I hope this helps out anyone else trying to add Spotify to their project, and only ask that you give me credit for my work if you use my code. I have no license attatched to this, so... enjoy!

The code might not be as well put together as I could make it. I spent a while trying to get a session to activate properly and changing the code around. Take special note of the plist. It may have extraneous parts, but some of it will likely be necessary to get the project working.
